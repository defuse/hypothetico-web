        Submitting to Hypothetico
    </div>

    <div class="boxcontent">

    <p>
    What sets Hypothetico apart from other e-zines is our <em>lack</em> of
    regard for the truth. An interesting idea in its raw form, not
    constrained by the requirement of truth or rationality, can lead to new
    insights in existing fields, and even the creation of completely new
    fields of study. Of course, once the new insights are made, they should
    be subjected to reason and scientific rigor if they are to be used in
    practice. Hypothetico acts as a &quot;safe zone&quot; for the
    early publication strange, even controversial, ideas.
    </p>

    <p>
    We are particularly interested in:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Isomorphisms between fields.</li>
        <li>Strange ways of thinking of well-known things.</li>
        <li>Strange ways of explaining things.</li>
        <li>Multiple levels of meaning.</li>
        <li>Anything thought-provoking.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Hypothetico only publishes ASCII text files, such as those made with a text
    editor like notepad, Vim, or Emacs. Submissions should be formatted so that
    no line is longer than 80 characters, and should not be longer than 200
    lines. The length requirement may seem harsh, but we are interested in
    thought-provoking ideas, and we want to leave the reader with time to think.
    There is no minimum length. If you can do something really clever in one
    line, we'll accept it.
    </p>

    <p>
    As always, please use correct spelling and grammar, unless not doing so is
    an intentional component of your work. Your submission doesn't have to be
    English prose, though. It could be a poem, sequence of mathematical
    equations, unique ASCII art, or even a nonsensical sequence of characters
    that exhibits some interesting pattern.
    </p>

    <p>
    You may submit as many times you want. In fact, we encourage you to submit
    multiple times. 
    </p>

    <p>
