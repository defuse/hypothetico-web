        What is Hypothetico?
    </div>

        <p>
        Hypothetico is a new quarterly electronic magazine. Hypothetico features
        short ASCII texts that make you think. We accept writings on any topic
        (fiction or non-fiction) and in any format, within the limitations of
        7-bit ASCII. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Hypothetico is all about strange and controversial ideas. We do not
        require submissions to undergo any kind of peer review process. We do
        not even require submissions to contain a truth or to be rational.
        Hypothetico is a &quot;safe zone&quot; for the publication of
        interesting and thought provoking, but unusual, ideas. Readers must keep
        these facts in mind as they read. For more information about
        Hypothetico's philosophy, read the <a href="/hypothetico/submit.htm">submissions page</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
        We are particularly interested in:

        <ul>
            <li>Isomorphisms between fields.</li>
            <li>Strange ways of thinking of well-known things.</li>
            <li>Strange ways of explaining things.</li>
            <li>Multiple levels of meaning.</li>
            <li>Anything thought-provoking.</li>
