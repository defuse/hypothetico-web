        What is Hypothetico?
    </div>

        <p>
        Hypothetico is a new quarterly electronic magazine. Hypothetico features
        short ASCII texts that make you think. We accept writings on any topic
        (fiction or non-fiction) and in any format, within the limitations of
        7-bit ASCII. 
        </p>

        <p>
        What sets Hypothetico apart from other e-zines is our <em>lack</em> of
        regard for the truth. An interesting idea in its raw form, not
        constrained by the requirement of truth or rationality, can lead to new
        insights in existing fields, and even the creation of completely new
        fields of study. Of course, once the new insights are made, they should
        be subjected to reason and scientific rigor if they are to be used in
        practice. Hypothetico acts as a &quot;safe zone&quot; for the
        early publication strange, even controversial, ideas.
